The Final Exam is due on December 5th by 11:59 PM.
Exam questions are in the `finalexam.pdf` file.

You must push your local repository back to GitHub before the deadline.
Your repository must contain:

-   The MATLAB code you used to complete the exam in its entirety (including auxiliary functions and scripts);
-   A `main.m` file that should generate all plots for all exam exercises when run;
-   A `report.pdf` file with your answers to the exam questions.

The exam uses stock and options data.
This data should not be pushed to the repository.
Instead, keep it in a `Data` folder outside your project folder.
The options data is available on Sakai.

Notice the repository contains a Matlab function called `BLScallput.m`, it is used in some questions of the final exam to compute BLS prices.
